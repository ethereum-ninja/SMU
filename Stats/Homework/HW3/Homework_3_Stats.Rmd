Question 1:  

```{r}
sample = c(1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 2.0, 2.3, 1.6, 1.6, 1.8, 1.5, 1.7, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.6, 1.6)
t.test(x=sample, mu = 1.8, conf.int = "TRUE", alternative = "two.sided")

```
Question 2
```{r}
Fired = c(34, 37, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44, 44, 45, 45, 45, 46, 48, 49, 53, 53, 54, 54, 55, 56)
Not_fired = c(27, 33, 36, 37, 38, 38, 39, 42, 42, 43, 43, 44, 44, 44, 45, 45, 45, 45, 46, 46, 47, 47, 48, 48, 49, 49, 51, 51, 52, 54)
t.test(x = Fired, y = Not_fired, conf.int = .95, var.equal = TRUE, alternative = "two.sided")

```
Question 3
H0 m1 = m2 (means are equal)
Ha m1 â‰  m2 


```{r}
SMU = c(34, 1200, 23, 50, 60, 50, 0, 0, 30, 89, 0, 300, 400, 20, 10, 0)
Seattle = c(20, 10, 5, 0, 30, 50, 0, 100, 110, 0, 40, 10, 3, 0, NaN, NaN)
t.test(x = SMU, y = Seattle, conf.int=.95, var.equal = TRUE, alternative = "two.sided")
