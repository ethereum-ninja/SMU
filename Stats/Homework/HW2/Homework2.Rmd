Question 1:  

```{r}
sample = c(1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 2.0, 2.3, 1.6, 1.6, 1.8, 1.5, 1.7, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.6, 1.6)
t.test(x=sample, mu = 1.8, conf.int = "TRUE", alternative = "two.sided")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
