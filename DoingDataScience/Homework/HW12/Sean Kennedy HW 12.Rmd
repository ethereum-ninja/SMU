```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(sqldf)

```

## Load Data
```{r}
help("EuStockMarkets")
EuDF = data.frame(EuStockMarkets)
dax = sqldf('SELECT DAX FROM EuDF' )
plot(dax)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
